## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.2] — 2026-07-11
### Fixed
- **Extension host — A1:** Replaced `catch (error: any)` with `catch (err: unknown)` and a proper `instanceof Error` type guard, preventing silent `"Error: undefined"` messages when a non-Error value was thrown.
- **Extension host — A2:** Added an idempotent guard flag to `restartServer()` to prevent concurrent restart calls from spawning multiple LSP client instances simultaneously (race condition).
- **Extension host — A3:** Added `.catch(() => {})` to `client.stop()` in `deactivate()` so a rejection from an already-exited server process no longer surfaces as an unhandled error.
- **Extension host — A4:** Typed `statusBarItem` as `vscode.StatusBarItem | undefined` to align the declaration with its actual lifecycle (initialized inside `activate()`).
- **Extension host — A5:** Documented the intentional `debug: run` configuration (thin-client design decision — server-side debugging is done by attaching directly to the zenzic process).
- **Extension host — A6:** Added pre-flight validation for non-default `executablePath` settings: if the binary is not found/executable before attempting to spawn the LSP, an immediate, user-friendly error notification is shown instead of a cryptic LSP crash message.
- **CI/CD — C1:** Aligned `release.yml` action versions with `ci.yml` (`actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v6`).
- **CI/CD — C2:** Removed redundant `npm run build` step from `release.yml`; `vsce package` already runs `vscode:prepublish` (which calls `npm run build --production`) internally — previously caused two consecutive builds.
- **CI/CD — C3:** Upgraded `softprops/action-gh-release` from `v2` to `v3` for Node 24 runtime compatibility.
- **Tooling — E1:** Removed stale reference to `.eslintrc.json` from `REUSE.toml` (file was deleted during ESLint Flat Config migration in `0.21.1`).
- **Tooling — B2:** Re-enabled `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` and `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` as `warn` (were incorrectly set to `off`).
- **Tooling — B1:** Added comprehensive documentation to the `Module._load` shim in `eslint.config.mjs` explaining the workaround's scope, risk, and removal criteria.
- **Tooling — F1:** Removed redundant `noImplicitAny: true` from `tsconfig.json` (already enabled by `strict: true`).
- **Tooling — F2:** Bumped `tsconfig.json` `target` and `lib` from `es2020` to `es2022` to align with the Node 24 runtime.

## [0.21.1] — 2026-07-11
### Changed
- **Infrastructure:** Consolidated major dependency upgrades across the repository. Bumped TypeScript to v7, migrated ESLint to Flat Config (`eslint.config.mjs`), and updated `vscode-languageclient` to v10. Updated GitHub Actions runner environments to latest LTS versions.
